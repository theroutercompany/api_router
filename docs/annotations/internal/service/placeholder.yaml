file: internal/service/placeholder.go
title: internal/service/placeholder.go
overview:
  what: |
    Minimal placeholder package and type for future internal service orchestration.

    Today this file intentionally does almost nothing. It exists so the repository can
    safely depend on `internal/service` without committing to an API surface prematurely.
  why: |
    The gateway's runtime wiring currently lives mostly in `pkg/gateway/runtime` and `pkg/gateway/server`.

    As the project grows, it is common to introduce an internal "service layer" that coordinates:
    - startup/shutdown of multiple subsystems
    - lifecycle hooks and dependency injection
    - shared cross-cutting concerns (backoff policies, schedulers, etc)

    This placeholder provides a stable import path for that future work without blocking current development.
  how: |
    - `Placeholder` is an empty struct (zero size).
    - `NewPlaceholder()` returns a pointer to a new instance.
  notes: |
    When real services are introduced, this file is expected to be replaced or expanded.
    Do not build new production behavior on top of this placeholder type.
symbols:
  func NewPlaceholder:
    what: Constructs a no-op placeholder service instance.
    why: Mirrors the "constructor returns pointer" pattern used throughout the repo, making it easy to evolve later.
    how: Returns `&Placeholder{}`.
    notes: ""
  type Placeholder:
    what: Empty struct used as scaffolding for future internal services.
    why: Keeps the `internal/service` package non-empty and provides a hook for future orchestration services.
    how: Declared as `struct{}` with no fields.
    notes: This type intentionally carries no behavior.
