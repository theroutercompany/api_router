## High-level layout

- `cmd/`: CLI entrypoints (`apigw` is the primary runtime CLI).
- `pkg/gateway/`: SDK surface + gateway runtime packages (config, server, proxy, auth, metrics).
- `internal/`: supporting services (OpenAPI merge, readiness/health, shadow diff tooling).
- `specs/`: OpenAPI fragments merged into `dist/openapi.json`.
- `test/acceptance/`: black-box acceptance tests that exercise the gateway behavior.
- `docs/`: Docusaurus documentation site (you are here).
- `docs-archive/`: previous markdown docs (preserved during migration).
