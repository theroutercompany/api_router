## High-level layout

- `cmd/`: CLI entrypoints (`apigw` is the primary runtime CLI).
- `pkg/gateway/`: SDK surface + gateway runtime packages (config, server, proxy, auth, metrics).
- `internal/`: supporting services (OpenAPI merge, readiness/health, shadow diff tooling).
- `specs/`: OpenAPI fragments merged into `dist/openapi.json`.
- `test/acceptance/`: black-box acceptance tests that exercise the gateway behavior.
- `docs/`: Docusaurus documentation site.
- `docs-archive/`: previous markdown docs (preserved during migration).

## Where to start reading code

1. `cmd/apigw/main.go` (CLI wiring)
2. `pkg/gateway/runtime/runtime.go` (runtime composition)
3. `pkg/gateway/server/server.go` (HTTP server + routes + middleware)
4. `pkg/gateway/proxy/reverse_proxy.go` (proxy behavior)
5. `pkg/gateway/config/config.go` (all configuration shapes and defaults)
