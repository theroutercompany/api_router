- **Upstream**: A backend service the gateway proxies to (e.g. trade/task). See [Proxy](../architecture/proxy).
- **Readiness**: `GET /readyz` performs upstream checks before reporting healthy. See [Troubleshooting](../guides/troubleshooting) and [Health checker](../annotated/internal/platform/health/).
- **Admin server**: Control-plane HTTP server (status/config/reload) typically bound to localhost. See [Admin API](../reference/admin-api).
- **Problem+JSON**: Standard error format returned by some gateway handlers. See [Problem+JSON](../reference/problems).
