## Source

- Package: `shadowdiff`
- File: `internal/shadowdiff/fixture.go`
- GitHub: https://github.com/theroutercompany/api_router/blob/main/internal/shadowdiff/fixture.go

## Overview

**What:**

Defines the fixture schema used by shadowdiff and provides a helper to load fixture files from disk.

A fixture is a captured HTTP request description plus minimal expectations used for analysis.

**Why:**

Shadow diff runs should be deterministic and easy to share.

Storing fixtures as JSON files on disk makes it easy to:
- add new scenarios by committing new fixture files
- review and version fixture changes like code
- replay the same requests against different gateway versions

**How:**

`LoadFixtures(paths)` reads each fixture file (each file contains a JSON array of fixtures),
decodes it into `[]Fixture`, and concatenates the results into one slice.

**Notes:**

Fixtures are request-focused. The runner currently compares response status and body,
and uses `ExpectStatus` mostly as metadata for humans.


## Imports

### `import` block 1

```go title="internal/shadowdiff/fixture.go#L3" showLineNumbers
import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)
```


## Types

### `type` block 1

```go title="internal/shadowdiff/fixture.go#L10" showLineNumbers
type Fixture struct {
	Name         string            `json:"name"`
	Method       string            `json:"method"`
	Path         string            `json:"path"`
	Headers      map[string]string `json:"headers"`
	Body         json.RawMessage   `json:"body"`
	ExpectStatus int               `json:"expectStatus"`
}
```

#### `Fixture`

**What:** A single captured HTTP request scenario.

**Why:** Provides the input needed to replay a request (method, path, headers, body) and label it for reporting.

**How:** Stored and loaded as JSON; the runner uses it to build requests and to label output.

**Notes:** The `Body` field uses `json.RawMessage` so fixtures can represent arbitrary JSON payloads without schema coupling.


## Functions and Methods

### `LoadFixtures`

**What:** Loads one or more fixture files from disk.

**Why:** Allows a shadowdiff session to be composed from multiple fixture files (grouped by feature or endpoint).

**How:** For each path, reads the file, unmarshals an array of fixtures, and appends them into a single slice.

**Notes:** Errors include the fixture path for debugging.

```go title="internal/shadowdiff/fixture.go#L20" showLineNumbers
func LoadFixtures(paths []string) ([]Fixture, error) {
	var fixtures []Fixture
	for _, path := range paths {
		data, err := os.ReadFile(path)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("read fixture %s: %w", path, err)
		}

		var fileFixtures []Fixture
		if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &fileFixtures); err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("decode fixture %s: %w", path, err)
		}
		fixtures = append(fixtures, fileFixtures...)
	}
	return fixtures, nil
}
```

#### Walkthrough

The list below documents the top-level statements inside the function body.

- **L21**: `var fixtures []Fixture`
  - **What:** Declares local names.
  - **Why:** Introduces variables or types used later in the function.
  - **How:** Executes a Go declaration statement inside the function body.
- **L22**: `for _, path := range paths { data, err := os.ReadFile(path) if err != nil { return nil, fmt.Errorf("read fixture %s: %w", path, err) } var …`
  - **What:** Iterates over a collection.
  - **Why:** Processes multiple elements with the same logic.
  - **How:** Executes a `for ... range` loop.
- **L34**: `return fixtures, nil`
  - **What:** Returns from the current function.
  - **Why:** Ends the current execution path and hands control back to the caller.
  - **How:** Executes a `return` statement (possibly returning values).
