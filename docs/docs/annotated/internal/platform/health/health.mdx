## Overview

**What:** Implements readiness probing against configured upstream services and returns structured reports.

**Why:** The gateway should only be considered ready when its upstream dependencies are reachable and responding successfully.

**How:** A `Checker` fans out HTTP GET probes to each configured upstream health endpoint, aggregates results, and returns a status of `ready` or `degraded`.


## Imports

### `import` block 1

```go title="internal/platform/health/health.go#L3" showLineNumbers
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"net/url"
	"sync"
	"time"
)
```


## Types

### `type` block 1

```go title="internal/platform/health/health.go#L13" showLineNumbers
type Upstream struct {
	Name       string
	BaseURL    string
	HealthPath string
}
```

#### `Upstream`

**What:** Identifies an upstream dependency to probe.

**Why:** Readiness needs at least a name, base URL, and health path per dependency.

**How:** Provided by configuration and consumed by the runtime and checker.

### `type` block 2

```go title="internal/platform/health/health.go#L20" showLineNumbers
type UpstreamReport struct {
	Name       string    `json:"name"`
	Healthy    bool      `json:"healthy"`
	StatusCode int       `json:"statusCode,omitempty"`
	Error      string    `json:"error,omitempty"`
	CheckedAt  time.Time `json:"checkedAt"`
}
```

#### `UpstreamReport`

**What:** Outcome of probing a single upstream.

**Why:** Enables debugging readiness failures by surfacing status codes and errors per dependency.

**How:** Populated by `probe` and included in the aggregated `Report`.

### `type` block 3

```go title="internal/platform/health/health.go#L29" showLineNumbers
type Report struct {
	Status    string           `json:"status"`
	CheckedAt time.Time        `json:"checkedAt"`
	Upstreams []UpstreamReport `json:"upstreams"`
}
```

#### `Report`

**What:** Aggregated readiness status plus per-upstream results.

**Why:** Callers need a structured way to understand which upstream is failing and when checks ran.

**How:** Returned by `Readiness` with `status`, `checkedAt`, and a slice of `UpstreamReport`.

### `type` block 4

```go title="internal/platform/health/health.go#L36" showLineNumbers
type Checker struct {
	client    *http.Client
	upstreams []Upstream
	timeout   time.Duration
	userAgent string
}
```

#### `Checker`

**What:** Holds readiness probing dependencies and configuration.

**Why:** Allows the runtime to reuse a single configured checker across requests.

**How:** Stores the HTTP client, list of upstreams, timeout, and user-agent used by probes.


## Functions and Methods

### `NewChecker`

**What:** Constructs a `Checker` with an HTTP client, upstream list, per-probe timeout, and user-agent.

**Why:** Centralizes defaults and keeps runtime wiring simple.

**How:** Applies defaults when inputs are missing and stores the fields used by `Readiness`.

```go title="internal/platform/health/health.go#L44" showLineNumbers
func NewChecker(client *http.Client, upstreams []Upstream, timeout time.Duration, userAgent string) *Checker {
	if client == nil {
		client = http.DefaultClient
	}
	if timeout <= 0 {
		timeout = 2 * time.Second
	}
	if userAgent == "" {
		userAgent = "api-router-gateway/readyz"
	}

	return &Checker{
		client:    client,
		upstreams: upstreams,
		timeout:   timeout,
		userAgent: userAgent,
	}
}
```

#### Walkthrough

The list below documents the statements inside the function body, including nested blocks and inline closures.

- **L45**: `if client == nil { client = http.DefaultClient }`

  - **What:** Returns from the current function.
  - **Why:** Ends the current execution path and hands control back to the caller.
  - **How:** Executes a `return` statement (possibly returning values).

### `(*Checker).Readiness`

**What:** Probes all configured upstreams and returns an aggregated readiness report.

**Why:** Readiness must reflect the combined health of dependencies, not just process liveness.

**How:** Runs probes concurrently, collects `UpstreamReport` entries, and marks the overall status as `degraded` if any upstream is unhealthy.

```go title="internal/platform/health/health.go#L64" showLineNumbers
func (c *Checker) Readiness(ctx context.Context) Report {
	if len(c.upstreams) == 0 {
		return Report{Status: "ready", CheckedAt: time.Now().UTC()}
	}

	results := make([]UpstreamReport, len(c.upstreams))
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for idx, upstream := range c.upstreams {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(i int, u Upstream) {
			defer wg.Done()
			results[i] = c.probe(ctx, u)
		}(idx, upstream)
	}

	wg.Wait()

	report := Report{
		CheckedAt: time.Now().UTC(),
		Upstreams: results,
	}

	report.Status = "ready"
	for _, r := range results {
		if !r.Healthy {
			report.Status = "degraded"
			break
		}
	}

	return report
}
```

### `(*Checker).probe`

**What:** Probes a single upstream health endpoint and returns an `UpstreamReport`.

**Why:** Keeps per-upstream probing logic isolated and testable.

**How:** Builds the full URL from base + health path, creates a context with timeout, sends a GET request with a user-agent, and treats non-2xx responses as unhealthy with an error message.

```go title="internal/platform/health/health.go#L98" showLineNumbers
func (c *Checker) probe(ctx context.Context, upstream Upstream) UpstreamReport {
	checkedAt := time.Now().UTC()
	report := UpstreamReport{
		Name:      upstream.Name,
		Healthy:   false,
		CheckedAt: checkedAt,
	}

	targetURL, err := url.JoinPath(upstream.BaseURL, upstream.HealthPath)
	if err != nil {
		report.Error = fmt.Sprintf("failed to build upstream url: %v", err)
		return report
	}

	reqCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, c.timeout)
	defer cancel()

	req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(reqCtx, http.MethodGet, targetURL, nil)
	if err != nil {
		report.Error = fmt.Sprintf("failed to create request: %v", err)
		return report
	}

	req.Header.Set("User-Agent", c.userAgent)

	resp, err := c.client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		select {
		case <-reqCtx.Done():
			report.Error = reqCtx.Err().Error()
		default:
			report.Error = err.Error()
		}
		return report
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	report.StatusCode = resp.StatusCode
	report.Healthy = resp.StatusCode >= 200 && resp.StatusCode < 300
	if !report.Healthy {
		report.Error = fmt.Sprintf("health check failed with status %d", resp.StatusCode)
	}

	return report
}
```
