## Source

- Package: `service`
- File: `internal/service/placeholder.go`
- GitHub: https://github.com/theroutercompany/api_router/blob/main/internal/service/placeholder.go

## Overview

**What:**

Minimal placeholder package and type for future internal service orchestration.

Today this file intentionally does almost nothing. It exists so the repository can
safely depend on `internal/service` without committing to an API surface prematurely.

**Why:**

The gateway's runtime wiring currently lives mostly in `pkg/gateway/runtime` and `pkg/gateway/server`.

As the project grows, it is common to introduce an internal "service layer" that coordinates:
- startup/shutdown of multiple subsystems
- lifecycle hooks and dependency injection
- shared cross-cutting concerns (backoff policies, schedulers, etc)

This placeholder provides a stable import path for that future work without blocking current development.

**How:**

- `Placeholder` is an empty struct (zero size).
- `NewPlaceholder()` returns a pointer to a new instance.

**Notes:**

When real services are introduced, this file is expected to be replaced or expanded.
Do not build new production behavior on top of this placeholder type.


## Types

### `type` block 1

```go title="internal/service/placeholder.go#L4" showLineNumbers
type Placeholder struct{}
```

#### `Placeholder`

**What:** Empty struct used as scaffolding for future internal services.

**Why:** Keeps the `internal/service` package non-empty and provides a hook for future orchestration services.

**How:** Declared as `struct{}` with no fields.

**Notes:** This type intentionally carries no behavior.


## Functions and Methods

### `NewPlaceholder`

**What:** Constructs a no-op placeholder service instance.

**Why:** Mirrors the "constructor returns pointer" pattern used throughout the repo, making it easy to evolve later.

**How:** Returns `&Placeholder{}`.

```go title="internal/service/placeholder.go#L7" showLineNumbers
func NewPlaceholder() *Placeholder {
	return &Placeholder{}
}
```

#### Walkthrough

The list below documents the statements inside the function body, including nested blocks and inline closures.

- **L8**: `return &Placeholder{}`
  - **What:** Returns from the current function.
  - **Why:** Ends the current execution path and hands control back to the caller.
  - **How:** Executes a `return` statement (possibly returning values).
