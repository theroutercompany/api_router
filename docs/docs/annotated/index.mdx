title: Annotated Source

This section is the “read the code with a guide” layer.

Each core file gets:

- a high-level purpose and context
- an index of declarations (constants, variables, types, functions/methods)
- **What / How / Why** explanations for each symbol
- a function walkthrough that breaks down statements (including nested blocks and inline closures)
- Go code snippets with syntax highlighting and line numbers

Pages under `annotated/` are generated and then enriched with human-written explanations.
