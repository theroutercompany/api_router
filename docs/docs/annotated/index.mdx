title: Annotated Source
---

This section is the “read the code with a guide” layer.

Each core file gets:

- a high-level purpose and context
- an index of declarations (constants, variables, types, functions/methods)
- **What / How / Why** explanations for each symbol
- a function walkthrough that breaks down statements (including nested blocks and inline closures)
- Go code snippets with syntax highlighting and line numbers

Pages under `annotated/` are generated and then enriched with human-written explanations.

## Navigation tips

- Use the sidebar to browse by package/path.
- Each annotated page includes a “Related docs” section to jump to the relevant Guides/Reference/Architecture pages.
- Symbol headings have stable anchors (for example, `#type-config` or `#func-load`) so other docs can deep-link to the exact declaration.

## How it’s generated

- Tooling guide: [Documentation tooling](../guides/documentation)
- Generator source (annotated): [docsgen](./cmd/docsgen/main)
