## Runtime composition

The gateway is assembled in layers:

1. **Config**: loads and validates YAML + environment overrides.
   - Concepts: [Configuration model](./config)
   - Code: [Config loader](../annotated/pkg/gateway/config/)
2. **Runtime**: composes the server, readiness checker, and metrics registry.
   - Concepts: [Runtime](./runtime)
   - Code: [Runtime](../annotated/pkg/gateway/runtime/)
3. **Server**: mounts routes and middleware, and wires proxy/webhook handlers.
   - Concepts: [Server](./server)
   - Code: [Server](../annotated/pkg/gateway/server/), [Middleware](../annotated/pkg/gateway/server/middleware/)
4. **Proxy**: forwards requests to upstreams and handles streaming protocols.
   - Concepts: [Proxy](./proxy)
   - Code: [Reverse proxy](../annotated/pkg/gateway/proxy/reverse_proxy)
