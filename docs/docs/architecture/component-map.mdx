## Runtime composition

The gateway is assembled in layers:

1. **Config**: `pkg/gateway/config` loads and validates YAML + environment overrides.
2. **Runtime**: `pkg/gateway/runtime` builds the HTTP server, readiness checker, and metrics registry.
3. **Server**: `pkg/gateway/server` mounts routes and middleware.
4. **Proxy**: `pkg/gateway/proxy` implements upstream reverse proxying and streaming behavior.
