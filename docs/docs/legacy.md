# Legacy Docs

The documentation that previously lived under `docs/` was moved to `docs-archive/` when the Docusaurus site was introduced.

- Repo path: `docs-archive/`
- GitHub: https://github.com/theroutercompany/api_router/tree/main/docs-archive

If you’re new to the codebase, prefer the new structure:

- [Start Here](./start-here/)
- [Guides](./guides/)
- [Reference](./reference/)
- [Annotated Source](./annotated/)
