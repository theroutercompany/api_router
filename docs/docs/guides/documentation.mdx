title: Documentation Tooling
---

This repo’s documentation site is a Docusaurus project located under `docs/`.

The “Annotated Source” section is generated from Go source to provide symbol-by-symbol and statement-by-statement (walkthrough) documentation with syntax-highlighted snippets.

## Where things live

- Docusaurus site root: `docs/`
- Docs content: `docs/docs/`
- Annotated source output (generated): `docs/docs/annotated/`
- Human commentary for annotated pages: `docs/annotations/`
- Generator CLI: `cmd/docsgen/main.go`

## Regenerate annotated source pages

From the repo root:

```bash
go run ./cmd/docsgen
```

Notes:

- Generated MDX is committed to the repo so the site can build without running Go during the docs build.
- Edit commentary in `docs/annotations/**` and re-run docsgen rather than editing `docs/docs/annotated/**` by hand.

## Walkthrough depth/size controls

```bash
# Disable statement walkthroughs entirely
go run ./cmd/docsgen -walkthrough=false

# Increase coverage for very large functions
go run ./cmd/docsgen -walkthrough-max-depth 8 -walkthrough-max-steps 2000
```

## Deep dive

- Generator (annotated): [docsgen](../annotated/cmd/docsgen/main)
